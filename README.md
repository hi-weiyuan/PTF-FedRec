# ICDE-HideYourModel
This is the implementation of our paper "Hide Your Model: A Parameter Transmission-free Federated Recommender System"

# Dataset
The dataset can be downloaded via [ML](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/), [Steam-200K](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tamber/steam-video-games), and [Gowalla](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/loc-gowalla.html)

# How to run
1. Create /Data directory and download the data file, divide data into train (train.dat) and test (test.dat) set.
2. Set hyperparameters via parse.py. (The default setting is for main experimental results.)
3. Run main.py.
